# CS2019-Four4s

You will create a program that will use just 4 fours and math to create all numbers from 0 to 9.  

Using only the arithmetic operations +, -, * (multiplication), / (division), // (integer division), parens ( ), and ** (power) to compute the values 0 through 9 using exactly four fours. (you can use 44 if youâ€™d like, but it counts as two fours).

The output when you run your program should look like this:

Zero is 0

One is 1	

Two is 2

Three is 3

Four is 4

Five is 5

etc

**FEELING GOOD?  also compute 10-12**
